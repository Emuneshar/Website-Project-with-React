        <p>
          My name is Neliza Perez, my passion for womenâ€™s healthcare led me to
          become the registered diagnostic medical sonographer that I am today.
          As I progressed through my career my love for OBGYN grew immensely!
          Which is why I decided to open my own business BABY SONO VIEWS where I
          provide exceptional imaging for you and your family to enjoy. My goal
          is to provide a once in a lifetime experience for you and your baby.
          Thank you for allowing me to be part of this journey with you.
